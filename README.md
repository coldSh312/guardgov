GuardGov is an open-source project designed to tackle corruption and conflicts of interest in the public sector. This project aims to leverage modern technologies like AI, data analysis, and transparency tools to ensure fair decision-making and accountability.

## Problem Statement
Government officials are sometimes influenced by personal interests or future employment opportunities with companies they are tasked to regulate. This leads to biased decisions, corruption, and a lack of public trust.

GuardGov seeks to:
- Identify potential conflicts of interest.
- Increase transparency in government decisions.
- Provide real-time alerts on suspicious patterns or relationships.

## Features
1. **Centralized Database**
   - Details of government officials, including roles and responsibilities.
   - Companies and entities under regulation.
   - Historical and current government contracts and decisions.

2. **AI-Powered Analytics**
   - Machine learning to detect suspicious relationships and patterns.
   - Real-time alerts for potential conflicts of interest.

3. **Public Transparency Portal**
   - Open access to data on government decisions, contracts, and connections.
   - Easy-to-use interface for citizens and watchdog organizations.

4. **Internal Alert System**
   - Notifications for oversight bodies on high-risk scenarios or decisions.

## Technologies
- **Backend:** Python (Flask/Django)
- **Frontend:** React/Angular
- **Database:** PostgreSQL/MySQL
- **AI Frameworks:** TensorFlow/PyTorch
